# Python-hackathon-2022
I have participated in a hackathon conducted by Northeastern University, US, along with my team members and won second prize. The topic was about "Thematic Analysis Of Song Lyrics" and analysis was done using Python libraries like (Numpy,Pandas,Seaborn,Nltk,Matplotlib) to study the sentiment/emotions of the song lyrics.
