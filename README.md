# Thematic Analysis of Song Lyrics

I have participated in a hackathon conducted by Northeastern University, San Jose, US, in 2022, along with my team members and were declared as Runner up.

Data cleaning and Exploratory data analysis were done on the dataset consisting of song lyrics and the important insights were visualized using different types of graphs and charts (GGPlot).

The topic was about "Thematic Analysis Of Song Lyrics" and analysis was done using Python libraries like (Numpy,Pandas,Seaborn,Nltk,Matplotlib) to study the sentiment/emotions of the song lyrics.
